# Apache Airflow ETL Pipelines

A collection of modular **Apache Airflow DAGs** demonstrating different ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows using a variety of Airflow operators.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This project serves as a personal portfolio to:
- Practice and demonstrate real-world data pipeline orchestration.
- Explore different types of Airflow operators and control flows.
- Build modular, reusable, and production-ready DAGs.

| `ETL_toll_data`  | Extracts toll data from multiple file formats, consolidates, and transforms it. | `BashOperator`                      |

> More DAGs will be added progressively as I experiment with different patterns and operators.
